# Twitter Memories Web
Twitter Memories is a service that uses your Twitter archive to provide you with a daily view of tweets you have made on the same day, in the past. It's a simple application that allows users to register, upload their twitter archive, and login every day to view their past tweets. 
 

This repo covers the React frontend, if you want to take a look at the backend code, it's [here](https://github.com/Gustavo-Cornejo/Twitter_Memories).
